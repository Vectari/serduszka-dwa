    > This is repository of "Biuro Matrymonialne Serduszka Dwa". Company from Bydgoszcz, Poland.
    > This is my first webpage created for real company. I wanted to create page easy and clear 
    > to use for elder user becouse mostly they are the clients of this company.

## What I learned in this project?
    > First of all CSS and JavaScript. I have much fun create this page with all features like 
    > sticky droplist navbar which is necessary for mobile users or optimizing everything for 
    > faster loading compared to the previous version.
